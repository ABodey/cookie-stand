    <h2>The miracle of delicious Salmon in cookies</h2>
    <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Here's something that's fun. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate.</p>

    <p>Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>

  <section class="dogTreats">

    <h2>We bake the best slamon dog treats too!</h2>
    <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

    <p>In this world, everything can be happy. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>

    <p>We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
